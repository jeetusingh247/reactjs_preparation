### Tailwind Shades Extension
We are using the Tailwind Shades extension for coloring. This extension helps in generating shades and tints for Tailwind CSS colors, making it easier to maintain a consistent color palette throughout the project. It provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and select colors, ensuring that the design remains cohesive and visually appealing.
